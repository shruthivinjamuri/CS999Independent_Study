Memo - Object Oriented Software Development Project.
Project purpose:
The first project mainly focuses on selecting the programming language to be used for the entire module and justifying the selection.
Description:
I choose the programming language JAVA for the development of the module and use eclipse IDE to code in Java.
The selection can be justified by discussing how the constraints in the project are dealt with:
The programming language should support modularity: Java classes, objects, packages, JAR files provide modularity.
Language should support automatic unit testing: Java provides JUnit, a unit testing framework.
Reading and writing XML should be supported: Java has different parsers such as - DOM parser, SAX parser, StAX parser to read and write XML.
Language should deal with tcp/ip sockets: Client/server application programming is easier in Java. The java.net package provides flexible
and powerful infrastructure for network programming.
Language should support constructing GUI: Java has AWT and Swing, graphics APIs which provide huge collection of reusable GUI components.
	In addition to handling the above constraints the jar file to the project could be deployed on Linux machines and the particular java code for the project could also
be run on my local windows machine without any changes to the computer/OS.
